# User Data (Exclude novels and personal data if needed, but for now user wants to upload "Yunshu System")
# Assuming Novels might contain user content, but maybe user wants them backed up?
# Keeping Novels for now as it seems to be part of the system's "memory" or content.
# If "Novels" is too large, we might want to ignore it, but I'll keep it unless it's huge.
